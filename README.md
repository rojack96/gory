# Gory

`gory` is a CLI tool written in Go that simulates the behavior of the bash `history` command, with added features to simplify searching and interactively executing past commands.

---

## Key Features

- Reads commands directly from the userâ€™s `.bash_history` file.
- Allows searching for commands containing a specific string.
- Allows limiting the number of returned commands.
- Enables interactive execution of a selected command after a terminal confirmation prompt.

---

## Installation

You can install `gory` by building the Go project:

```bash
go install github.com/rojack96/gory/cmd/gory@latest
```

Make sure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH`.

---

## Usage

### Options

* `-s`, `--search <string>`
  Search and display all commands in history that contain `<string>`.

* `-n`, `--number <num>`
  Limit the number of displayed commands to `<num>`.

---

### Examples

* Show the last 10 commands:

  ```bash
  gory -n 10
  ```

* Search all commands containing `docker`:

  ```bash
  gory -s docker
  ```

* Search and show up to 5 commands containing `git`:

  ```bash
  gory -s git -n 5
  ```

---

## Important Note

`gory` reads commands from `~/.bash_history`. To ensure the history is up to date, it is recommended to run:

```bash
history -a
```

before using `gory`.

---

## Interactive Execution

After displaying matching commands, `gory` will ask if you want to execute one of them via a simple confirmation prompt.

If you confirm, the selected command will be executed directly in your terminal.
